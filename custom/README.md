# Custom snippets

This folder contains custom cut-together snippets for some voices.

These are typically new stations that have opened or new TOCs that have started operating since the CIS systems (and recordings) were last updated.

These are made from the existing snippets provided under FOI, and are condition to the same limitations as those snippets as a result, but are not provided by the FOI contents themselves.
